## Project Description
The **Course Management System (CMS)** is designed to help instructors efficiently manage course enrollments, track student grades, and generate academic reports. The system will allow instructors to add and manage courses, enroll students, and input grades. Students will be able to access and track their grades through the system. By default, the program has group members Joseph and Hannah listed as registered students, each with grades of 96.5 and 88.0, respectively.

Key features of the CMS include:
- **Course Management**: Instructors can create, update, and delete courses and enroll students.
- **Grade Tracking**: Input, store, and update student grades across various assignments and exams.
- **Student Management**: Enroll, remove, or update student records.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generate reports that show student progress and overall performance in each course.
- **Simple Interface**: The system will have a straightforward, user-friendly interface to make the process as simple as possible for both students and instructors.

The CMS will be built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, ensuring a modular and organized codebase. It will utilize file handling to store the necessary data for courses, students, and grades, making sure all information is saved between uses.
